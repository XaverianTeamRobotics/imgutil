# imgutil
Image upload/delete utility for XaverianRoboticsTeam/imgs.

### Development
1. `npm i`
2. Execute the "Run imgutil Server" IDEA run configuration

### Building
Building is taken care of by the HelpPage buildscript, `deploy.py`

### Token
The file `./src/DO_NOT_TRACK_MUST_DELETE` is ignored by Git. It was ignored with the intention of being a safe place to store your GitHub token while developing.

### Typescript
This project uses a different version of Typescript than the documentation page does. You may need to change your version of Typescript in IDEA to work on this project properly. JetBrains is working on fixing this, see [WEB-29852](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-29852/Support-several-TypeScript-versions-in-one-project).
